        <ol>
            <li>
                Camels have three sets of eyelids and two rows of eyelashes to keep sand out of their eyes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Camels have thick lips which let them forage for thorny plants other animals can't eat.
            </li>
            <li>
                Camel can move easily across the sand because of its specially designed feet.

        </a>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Pigeons are incredibly complex and intelligent animals.
            </li>
            <li>
                They can also recognise each letter of the human alphabet,
                 differentiate between photographs, 
                 and even distinguish different humans within a photograph.
            </li>
            <li>
                Pigeons are one of only a small number of species to pass the ‘mirror test’ –
                 a test of self recognition.

        </a>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Teddy bears got their name from 
                the story that Teddy Roosevelt refused to shoot a bear cub while on a hunting trip in 1902.
            </li>
            <li>
                The first toy stuffed bear was created by German toymaker Margarete Steiff. 
                She created a soft plush with movable arms and legs and a friendly
                 face after taking her nephew to the zoo in 1903.
            </li>
            <li>
                The world's smallest stitched teddy bear is a mere 0.29 inches tall!
                 It was created by South African artist Cheryl Moss who is known for her minuscule work.

            <p>Interesting facts about flying cicadas.</p>
        </a>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Cicadas can survive a huge fall as babies, or nymphs. 
                They are about the size of a grain of rice when they drop from a 
                tree branch to the ground and start digging.
            <li>
                They improve lawns by digging tunnels that allow air into the soil. 
                When they die, their rotting bodies put nitrogen into the soil.
            </li>
            <li>
                Most have red-orange eyes. But occasionally cicadas have blue, white or grayish eyes.
            </li>
